# toronto-raptors-data-warehouse
Toronto Raptors is preparing for the upcoming NBA League 2024/2025. As a data-driven basketball club, they have gathered data on players performance and team performance. 

However, the data is scattered across multiple sources. Meanwhile, coaches need to make informed decision to evaluate past player and team performance to build game strategy for the next year league based on unified data.

Objectives:
Consolidate data from multiple sources into one central data warehouse as single source of truth. This data warehouse will be the reliable source for analyzing and building team and game strategy, considering both playerâ€™s and team past performance 

The data warehouse contains two data marts:
1. Player performance datamart
2. Team performance datamart
